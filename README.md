It's really simple.

The rbxl place file holds the setup for aligning thumbnail etc. so all you have to do is import and upload

The install packages simply installs pip, then numpy and pillow packages. numpy is just a numbers library, pillow has functions for image editing etc. that's it, you can install those yourself, let me know if there's any problems

The install packages also tries to move the paint.net extension into the effects folder, but it can't without admin access so it'll likely fail, you can just import it yourself.

The video really tells rest of the story
